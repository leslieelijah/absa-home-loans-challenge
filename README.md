# Between working and doing the test it would have been easier if I used bootstrap not my own freestyle to do the Styling as that could have save lots of time,

# I wanted to use to nodejs to get the json response and serve it ong the web app

# Used minimum RxJs and state management because this is simple to do without

# Please let me know of any feedback
